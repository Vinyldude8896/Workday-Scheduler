# Work Day Scheduler 

### User Story

As a User, I would like a task manager app that I can use during my workday. When I load this app I should see the hours of the workday on the left side from 9am-5pm, and beside each hour I shouold be able to enter a task. These tasks should save even when I navigate away or reload the page. If any task is approaching the time I would like it to highlight in another color to let me know that the lask is approaching the deadline.

### Features
This web application features task manager tool for hours 9am-5pm each day
This application will allow a user to enter a task at any hour of the day and save it.
These tasks will be saved to local storage and will persist when the app is reloaded.
If a task is approaching the deadline then the task will be highlighted in yellow as a warning the task needs to be completed.
If a task is past the deadline, the task will be highlighted in red as it has past.
